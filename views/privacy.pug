            | Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
            | If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.

            |Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the

        h2 Information Collection and Use
        p

        p

            | This request is associated with our Service. It is not associated with the Slack User ID of the user who made the request.
            | Our Service uses an API version of the Safe Browsing Service that requires any results from their Service be temporarily stored by our Service.
            | This prevents unneccessary calls to their Service. Typical storage time is around five minutes. These stored web addresses are not associated with any
            | Personal Information from our Service's users.
